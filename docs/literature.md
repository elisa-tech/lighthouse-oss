# Literature

Various publications from research have been made about the open source development process. A list of examples is placed below. A good overview on potential publications was done by the *Open Source Software Development Process: A Systematic Review* publication in 2020 [1]. The document also serves as an input for this work. However, the referenced work inside the paper only has limited evidence about OSS project making heavy use of CI/CD practices. Also, the workflows observed on GitHub and GitLab (to name to prominent example hosts for open source projects) are not reflected in the flow charts within the paper.

Further publications are listed below. In case they are further analyzed and assessed,
they will get a descriptive statement for their relevance to this work.

  **Abstract**
  Open Source Software (OSS) has been recognized by the software development community as an effective way to deliver software. Unlike traditional software development, OSS development is driven by collaboration among developers spread geographically and motivated by common goals and interests. Besides this fact, it is recognized by OSS community the need of understand OSS development process and its activities. Our goal is to investigate the state-of-art about OSS process through conducting a systematic literature review providing an overview of how the OSS community has been investigating OSS process over past years identifying and summarizing OSS process activities and their characteristics as well as translating OSS process in a macro process through BPMN notation. As a result, we systematically analyzed 33 studies presenting an overview of the state-of-art of researches regarding OSS process, a generalized OSS development macro process represented by BPMN notation with a detailed description of each OSS process activity and roles in OSS environment. We conclude that OSS process can be in practice further investigated by researchers. In addition, the presented OSS process can be used as a guide for OSS projects and being adapted according to each OSS project reality. It provides insights to managers and developers who want to improve their development process even in OSS and traditional environments. Finally, recommendations for OSS community regarding OSS process activities are provided.

  <summary>[2] Evaluation of open source operating
systems for safety-critical applications </summary>

  **Abstract**
  Today many embedded applications will have to handle multitasking with real-time time constraints and the solution for handling multitasking is to use a real-time operating system for scheduling and managing the real-time tasks. There are many different open source real-time operating systems available and the use of open source software for safety-critical applications is considered highly interesting by industries such as medical, aerospace and automotive as it enables a shorter time to market and lower development costs. If one would like to use open source software in a safety-critical context one would have to provide evidence that the software being used fulfills the requirement put forth by the industry specific standard for functional safety, such as the ISO 26262 standard for the automotive industry. However, the standards for functional safety do not provide a clear method for how one would go about certifying open source software. Therefore, in this thesis we present identified important characteristics that can be used for comparing the suitability of open source based real-time operating systems for use in safety-critical applications together with a proposed outline for a methodology that can be used for certifying an open source real-time operating system. A case study has been done where we compared two open source operating systems for small microcontrollers with the previously mentioned characteristics in order to see which of the two is most suitable for use in safety-critical applications. The most suitable candidate is then assessed in order to see to what degree it can adhere with the requirements put forth in the widely used functional safety standards IEC 61508 and ISO 26262.
