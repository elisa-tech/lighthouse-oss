# Example projects

The projects listed here are taken as examples for best practices.
They will get assessed and their best practices are described.

critical environments. 

## Hypothesis

The fundamental hypothesis is that a project which is used in cyber-security critical environment will have a decent quality state. The state will be achieved by following
practices to keep quality high. It is expected that not everything which is done for
this is getting documented.

This document will describe what is written down, link to evidence and also document what was not written down.
