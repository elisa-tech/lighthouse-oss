# Objective & Motivation

The established practice for the creation of electronic software-based control systems in regulated industries is based on methodological approaches that were developed for proprietary software development and do not take open source code driven development into account. However, the success of open source software in critical business and societal applications demonstrates its ability to deliver results comparable to proprietary development companies. 

Open source communities have proven their effectiveness and methodology, leading to widespread acceptance in areas with strict security regulations and certifications. This level of quality makes open source software a viable option for other regulated domains, including functional safety.

As a consequence, to enable the wider adoption of open source software in other (regulated) industries, it is crucial to ensure proper documentation of the processes executed by open source communities as e.g. safety standards enforce. This documentation will provide transparency and facilitate understanding of the methodologies employed, to be referred to as a quality management system for code driven development.

# Relation to functional safety

Quality, Cyber Security and Functional Safety (FuSa) integrity standards aim for a certain level of reliability for the development of electronic devices with a protective function for hazardous machines and systems that reduces the risk to people and society when operating these machines and systems to an acceptable level. All these standards, although aiming for different verticals as well as different risk scenarios, address the risk reduction by raising the resilience and stability of a software project.

To address this, FuSa integrity standards such as IEC 61508 or ISO 26262 describe a process with methods and tools for the development of electronic systems with safety relevant functions, with which the unavoidable risk of errors is reduced to an acceptable level. For the software part of these systems, these are essentially qualitative methods. Simply put, the core statement of the FuSa standards is that software that has been carefully developed according to the specifications cannot be improved with reasonable effort and is therefore suitable for use as a safety application.
